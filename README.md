# Time is Musical!

Musical Adaptation of WWV Time Station. I used PowerShell, FL Studio, and FFMPEG to stream this to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DK0yXZgulTk).

# Info

The base key is based on 60 Hz: very close to B-half-flat. The entire composition is generated by arranging the `.wav` tracks and arranging them in a way that communicates the UTC hour and minute in multiple creative ways.

### `cycle_s60_XX.wav`

Various orchestral tracks that play on selected minutes, such that no consecutive pair of tracks appear within the same hour.

`cycle_s60_00.wav` — exclusively on minute **59**; _has a longer coda to indicate the start of a new hour_.

`cycle_s60_01.wav` — minutes **01, 10, 24, 28, 37, 40, 48**.

`cycle_s60_02.wav` — minutes **09, 13, 21, 31, 46, 53, 57**.

`cycle_s60_03.wav` — minutes **14, 18, 23, 29, 56**.

`cycle_s60_04.wav` — minutes **04, 11, 16, 30, 34, 42, 47, 55**.

`cycle_s60_05.wav` — minutes **07, 17, 20, 33, 38, 58**.

`cycle_s60_06.wav` — minutes **12, 22, 27, 41, 44, 51**.

`cycle_s60_07.wav` — minutes **02, 06, 15, 36, 43, 52**.

`cycle_s60_08.wav` — minutes **00, 03, 08, 26, 32, 35, 49**.

`cycle_s60_09.wav` — minutes **05, 19, 25, 39, 45, 50, 54**.

### `cycle_s600.wav`, `minute_X0.wav`

Pluck track on the 5th/6th octaves that represent each digit of the _minute_ in binary; the difference in octave determines the binary represenation of that respective digit, with 1 corresponding with the higher octave. Patterns representing the tens decimal minute digit are placed in `minute_X0.wav`, whilst the units digit track loops every ten minutes in `cycle_s600.wav`.

`:00.5, :10.5, :25.5, :35.5` — **80**s minute digit _(always zero)_

`:01.0, :11.0, :26.0, :36.0` — **40**s minute digit

`:02.0, :12.0, :27.0, :37.0` — **20**s minute digit

`:03.0, :13.0, :28.0, :38.0` — **10**s minute digit

`:05.0, :15.0, :30.0, :40.0` — **08**s minute digit

`:06.0, :16.0, :31.0, :41.0` — **04**s minute digit

`:07.0, :17.0, :32.0, :42.0` — **02**s minute digit

`:08.0, :18.0, :33.0, :43.0` — **01**s minute digit

### `cycle_s60.wav`

Consistent tick loop that repeats every minute!
Ticks for seconds _29_ and _59_ are omitted.
Ticks are added at seconds _14.5, 45⅓, 46⅓_.

### `hour_XX.wav`

Synth tracks on the 4th octave that represent each digit of the _hour_ in binary. The major 1st and 3rd represent 0 and 1, respectively. The major 5th serves as a placeholder, and therefore does not store any data.

`:00 - :04` — N/A

`:05 - :09` — **80**s hour digit _(always zero)_

`:10 - :14` — **40**s hour digit _(always zero)_

`:15 - :19` — **20**s hour digit

`:20 - :24` — **10**s hour digit

`:25 - :29` — N/A

`:30 - :34` — **08**s hour digit

`:35 - :39` — **04**s hour digit

`:40 - :44` — **02**s hour digit

`:45 - :49` — **01**s hour digit

`:50 - :54` — N/A

`:55 - :59` — N/A
